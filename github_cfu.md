## Git Commands

1. touch <FILENAME.md> creates a file inside that directory. What I just did for this was I forked a repo then used <git clone> to clone that repo on my laptop. Then I went in that repo and created the github_cfu.md. Once I am done typing this I will go back to terminal and use the <git add> <FILENAME.md>.
1. Then I will use <git status> to see what changes have been made. It will tell me the changes but they are not commited.
1. I will use <git commit -m> to explain what I added to the github_cfu.md.
1. Once the changes have been commited, using <git push> will then push those changes from my local machine to the GitHub repo on the internet. Hitting refresh in Chrome I will then see the changes and can read this text from the <git push>.
